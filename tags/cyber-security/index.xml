      <description>A textbook that I wrote, Computer Systems Security: Planning for Success, is going to be featured during OEWeek! This scope, sequence, and need for this textbook came about through an NJIT Open and Affordable Textbook (OAT) grant. It was completed and piloted through an Open Textbook Collaborative (OTC) grant. The OTC is funded through the US Department of Educationâ€™s Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) program.
The goal is to provide an introductory text for students that roughly aligns with the CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 exam.</description>
