      <description>I remember talking to a friend about AWS a few years after we had both finished our undergrad degrees. He described it to me like this:
  Imagine you could take a Linux distro, install it, and set someone up with an SSH shell as soon as their credit card cleared. That’s AWS.
  — Mike   At this point, mid 2000s, we had both had plenty of experience with SSH and I used to jokingly say that it didn’t matter what computer I used because I was just using it to get to something better anyway.</description>
