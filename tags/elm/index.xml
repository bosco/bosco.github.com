      <description>I decided to begin developing a web app to keep track of groups in some of my classes. Ultimately Iâ€™d like to be able to automate project milestone check-ins for these groups (is your git repo up, can I clone it and run docker-compose, etc.) but the first part of that is just getting the groups and members in a database. Looking through the long list of things I would like to play with, I decided on developing the front end in Elm with Bulma for the styling.</description>
