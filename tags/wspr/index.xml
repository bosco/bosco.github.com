      <description>Purpose After examining the Doppler spread (w50) algorithm from FST4 and trying to understand how wpsrd works I decided to take the plunge and see if I could calculate Doppler spread from WSPR data. My initial idea was to use the c2 files created by wsprd as a data source. Thanks to the wsjtx-devel list, I soon discovered c2 files didnâ€™t have the data I thought they did.
So what I ended up implementing is a Python program that takes a WAV file as well as the wsprd output and calculates the Doppler spread for each decoded signal.</description>

      <title>Dissecting wsprd</title>

      <description>Purpose The goal of this article is to pick apart exactly how wsprd works. There seems to be plenty of things written about the WSPR encoding process, less things written about the decoding process, and frankly not a whole lot about how the tool bundled with WSJT-X actually does it. So in the UTSL spirit, I present a dissection of wsprd.
I will point out that this is going to be a lengthy article, feel free to take it in chunks.</description>
