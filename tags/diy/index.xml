      <description>Purpose My boat needs some new rope bags. The old Ronstad ones have held up incredibly well, but they just werent sticking to the back of the cockpit anymore. Lured in by the appeal of trying SNAD fasteners and having some leftover Sunbrella material from a sail cover I made, I decided to see if I could make them myself.
It should be noted that Sailrite does have a howto on making sheet bags but I was looking for something with a bit more structure.</description>
