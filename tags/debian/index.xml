      <description>Purpose My original homelab consisted of a Dell R710 which was a ton of fun to play with, but ultimately the turbojet noises and utility bill led me to bring it in to work and purchase a couple of broken Dell R610s. Between the two of them, I made one working one which has served (pun intended) me well.
 In an effort to further lower my utility bill, move the level of ambient noise from annoying to quiet, and play with some new hardware I&amp;#8217;ve decided to migrate to a small form factor (SFF) enterprise workstation.</description>
