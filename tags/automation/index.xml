      <description>I remember talking to a friend about AWS a few years after we had both finished our undergrad degrees. He described it to me like this:
Imagine you could take a Linux distro, install it, and set someone up with an SSH shell as soon as their credit card cleared. That’s AWS.
— Mike At this point, mid 2000s, we had both had plenty of experience with SSH and I used to jokingly say that it didn’t matter what computer I used because I was just using it to get to something better anyway.</description>

      <title>Automating TP-Link EAP225 Configuration</title>

      <description>Purpose As part of my continued efforts to automate the deployment of my home network, I ran into an interesting situation. Because I was using both Ubiquiti and TP-Link devices I needed to run two controllers to achieve my deployment goals. Running just one controller, the fabled UniFi controller, turned out to be enough of a pain ( here is a script based on that article BTW) and enough of a resource hog that I decided to forgo the setting up the Omada controller and just create my own solution for configuring wireless access points automatically.</description>

      <description>Purpose My original homelab consisted of a Dell R710 which was a ton of fun to play with, but ultimately the turbojet noises and utility bill led me to bring it in to work and purchase a couple of broken Dell R610s. Between the two of them, I made one working one which has served (pun intended) me well.
In an effort to further lower my utility bill, move the level of ambient noise from annoying to quiet, and play with some new hardware I’ve decided to migrate to a small form factor (SFF) enterprise workstation.</description>
