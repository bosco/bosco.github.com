      <description>I am a father of two, living in New Jersey and working as a university lecturer. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to work in several technological fields throughout my life with a significant amount of experience in the education realm. This site is meant to serve as a personal space to post information about what I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on with the hope being that other people can benefit from my posts as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from theirs.</description>

      <description>If you have a consulting opportunity that you think I may be interested in, please reach out to the email at the bottom of the page. I have significant experience in:
 Systems integration: Designing and maintaining frameworks for syncing services (Schoology, EducationCity, StudyIsland, Atlas Curriculum Management, NWEA MAP, etc.) with student information systems (Genesis). District Software Adoptions: District-wide subscription service rollouts (NWEA MAP, Schoology, Atlas Curriculum Management) including building the structures required for their continued support.</description>
